   <h1><p> The Story Behind the Numbers of Great Services <br/></p></h1>
   
      <h3> <p> The Josh Cleaning Services Family started its journey back in 2010. It all began with a meeting of two like-minded individuals, 
          company founders Josh Chima and Chima Junior. Josh needed a cleaner and Chima ran a cleaning business. 
          Very quickly they both realised that they shared a vision and could deliver home services in a much better way 
          by working together. </p></h3>
         <h3>With two laptops, a sofa to sit on, and a shared mobile phone a small operation, known only as the One 
             Stop Shop, was born. The aim was to build something simple, yet something that can deliver the best 
             possible service for all clients and cleaning crews involved. We call that philosophy the 360 degrees 
             of happiness. </p>
